# **Art Experiments**

## **Guidelines**

### **1.** `survivalist` repo is the training repo for art-experiments, kinda how `adventurist` is for pro-experiments. 

### **2.** If there is a "enter into master.md" line somewhere in the experiments, enter that something into "master.md" inside the survivalist repo keeping the directory structure. 


### **3.** If there is a "create a project" line somewhere in the experiments, create a project inside the survivalist repo keeping the directory structure.
