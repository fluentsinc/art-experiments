# **Layer Objects**

# **Experiment**

### **1.** Layer Objects or just objects, sometimes also referred to as "Graphic Objects", are graphic elements like "Shapes" and "Texts" that you learned how to create in earlier pilots. We create graphic art by putting different objects together in a way that is visually appealing for everybody. Create a xd file named "objects". Create a visually pleasing first  out of the objects you had learned in earlier pilots. Don't try to use advanced tools that you don't know. Just try to create a simple art with what you know.
