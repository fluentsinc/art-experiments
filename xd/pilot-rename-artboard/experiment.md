# **Rename Artboard**


# **Experiment**

### **1.** Your UX stories are going to have a lot of scenes(artboards). You need to name the artboards uniquely so that you can recognize the purpose of an artboard _**right away**_. When you create an artboard in XD, the artboard's title is automatically given a name based on the device screen size you had selected. We insist that you rename the default artboard name to something more specific. To rename the artboard, double-click on the artboard's title and type the new name for the artboard and press enter. Shadow the below gif into a project named "rename".
