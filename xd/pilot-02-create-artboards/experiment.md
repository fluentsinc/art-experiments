# **Create Artboards**

## Whenever you design the user experience of a product, you would want to think of making a movie with a _**kickass**_ story. The experience that the product offers to the _**end user**_ should be similar to the experience of watching a good movie where the scenes are carefully _**put together**_ by the director and the editor. 

## _**Along the same line**_, we want to create an user experience that flows like a great movie as the end user uses the product. As UX designers, we would spend most of our time creating scenes just like a movie director. In UX design, when we create an artboard we essentially mean we're creating a scene for our UX movie. Sometimes, we refer to the artboards as storyboards or sceneboards for this very reason. 

## This _**analogy**_ of user experience design with that of a movie experience is so widely used in many design studios. The analogy is being used so much so that some design studios actually call the UX prototypes as stories. What kind of story are the end user going to experience when they use the product? What kind of story are the end user going to tell their friends and family when they use the product?   

# **Experiment**

### **1.** Artboards are scenes in a UX story. As you launch Adobe XD, you would be asked for the kind of device that you want to create your UX story for. As of now, you would get an option for "Mobile", "Web", "Tablet" and "Custom Size". The size of the device screen determine the size of your artboards.
