# **Using UI kits**

## UI kits are generic(common, default) graphic elements that are unique to the design environment. For example, you might have used keyboard graphic element to type your message when you use messaging apps like whatsapp. The keyboard graphic element's appearance is quite different when you compare iOS and Android environments. 

### When you prototype using Adobe XD, you might want to use graphic elements like keyboard in your design and that's where UI kits help us out. Instead of creating graphic elements like this yourself, designers have already created these generic graphic elements for you to use in your designs. 

# **Experiment**

### **1.** Open up Adobe XD. The links to download UI kits are on the start screen. Missing that, you can also access the same links by clicking on the hamburger icon at the top left corner of the workspace window. Anyway we actually don't need to download the UI kits because the default UI kits in those links and other extra ones are already available to you in "Graphicon-Assets" folder. 

### **2.** To get a feel for using UI kit elements: open up "stickersheet-components.xd" file in "Graphicon-Assets" folder. Out of the available graphic elements you see when it opens up, copy either the "light" or "dark" version of the keyboard graphic element. ![](../images/pilot-02/keyboard-graphic-element.gif) 

### **3.** Now paste this graphic element into your Adobe XD project to use in your designs. ![](../images/pilot-02/keyboard-into-artboard.gif) 

### **4.** And that's how you can use existing graphic elements available in UI kits to accelerate the prototyping process. 

### **5.** This pilot doesn't extensively go over all the contents in "Graphicon-Assets" folder. So take a look at the available UI kits, Icon sets to get a feel for them. Also some UI kits work in prototype mode. Try using the preview button to see that for yourself. For instance, Navgo-UI-kit works in prototype mode, try the preview button to get a feel for them.
