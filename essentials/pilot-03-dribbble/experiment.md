# **Dribbble**

## Dribbble is a portfolio website where "creative artists" can showcase their artwork. It is similar to Behance. 


# **Experiment**

### **1.** Take a look at the website and have a look around: 

### https://www.dribbble.com/

### Dribbble is also a great place for you to look for inspiration just like Behance. 

### **2.** Dribbble is not part of Adobe so you need to sign up for it. Unlike Behance where you can upload and let others discover your artwork from the search _**right away**_, Dribbble uses a curated system to increase the quality of artwork showcased there. That being said, the artwork you upload appears only on your profile page and the draft page. It doesn't appear on the Official Dribbble search page until an experienced designer gives you an invitation. 

### On dribbble, players are experienced professional designers. Prospects are newly signed up designers. As a prospect, your artwork appears only on your profile page and the draft page. To get your artwork visible for the entire dribbble community, you need to get drafted(invited) by a player. A player might look at your artwork from the drafts page and might like your work enough to draft you.
